# Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP, ZK)
ZKP is a protocol in which one party can convince another party that a given statement is true without revealing any information. <br>
- *Interactive* proof of knowledge is the case in which doing multiple validations is required in order to prove the knowledge. <br>
- *Non-Interactive* proof of knowledge does not require multiple validations to prove knowledge. 

**Snarks** are sucicnt proofs that a certain statement is true, namely the proof is short and fast to verify.

## Cyptographic Background

1. Arithmetic Circuits: you find a finite field for a prime P > 2,  DAG's where internal nodes are operations (+, -, x) and entry nodes are values
2. Argument systems, they
