# AI for world and asset creation
- Technology stack: Game engines such as Unity, Unreal and Godot

## Current limitations
- Visual inconsistency
- Artistic intent
- "Stochastic" process
- Unoptimized models

## The pipeline
1. Concept drawing
2. Modeling
3. UV Unwrapping
4. Texturing & Shading
5. Rigging
6. Animating 


## Path to 6DoF
1. 360 video -> typical 360 videos with many cameras, doesnt provide immersion as it only covers 3DoF
2. Light maps
3. Photogrammetry -> software that analyzes thousands of photos of a scene to reconstruct a 3d mesh

_**Gaussian splat**_ is the most relevant tool/method right now for space generating from a couple of images



# Human in the loop
Having the human in control of the situation, the world react to him. TODO
